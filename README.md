Franjo Kluz
===========

Franjo Kluz will be a fun game to play. It is not at the moment because it is under heavy development. 

What kind of game it will be? Not sure at the moment but it will be some kind of adventure with mini games between your tasks. Franjo Kluz is the main character (historical figure). This game follows his jurney as pilot in Royal Yugoslav Air Force, Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia and Yugoslav Partisan Air Force.

## Previous Franjo

There [was this previous game Franjo Kluz](<http://www.binarni.net/projects/franjo/>). It was made more then 6 years ago as a technical test for new Canvas element. It was not even a game, it was more like 2-3 days of playing and having fun making sprites.
